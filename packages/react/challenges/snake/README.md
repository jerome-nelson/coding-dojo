## Challenge 2: Snake

A throwback to the Nokia 3310 days. What we have here is a good old-fashioned game of Snake. However it needs some improvements:

## Aims (Pick two/three if you feel confident):
1. Create a score counter
    - Score increments when "food" is eaten
2. Speed up snake as "food" is eaten
3. Collision Detection (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/2D_collision_detection)
    - if snake touches itself game should end
4. Show final score when game ends

## Bonus Points if you can do the following:
1. Convert to CSS Grid (no framework)
2. Expansion of Collision Detection
    - If the snake touches the wall then the game should end.
3. Build an API to store data between game launches

*Note: There are also bonus points/questions scattered around the codebase. Feel free to complete them*

# Data Structures

## Problem
Different types of data have different requirements. Thus, depending on the size, nature (dynamic/static) and operations the power required to process said data differs.
So how does a program do this efficiently?

This is where Data Structures can help. By defining a set of characteristics and constraints; data operations / storage can be made efficient.

## Data Constraints

Data is either efficie

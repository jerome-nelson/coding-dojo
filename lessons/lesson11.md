## Summary

This is a two-part dojo. The first half is coding-based; the second half will be our first introduction into Algorithms and Graph Calculations.

## Stage 1 - The Coding

The goal is to finish the code needed to complete a React Game of Snake. 
* [Code is found here](./packages/react/challenges/snake/)

### Student Objectives
1. Create a score counter
    - Score increments when "food" is eaten
2. Speed up snake as "food" is eaten
3. Collision Detection
    - if snake touches itself game should end
4. Show final score when game ends
5. Attempt to answer the questions scatered throughout the repository

### Dual Objectives - Teacher & Student should do these together
1. Expansion of Collision Detection
    - If the snake touches the wall then the game should end.
2. Build an API to store data between game launches

## Stage 2 - Breakdown of Mechanics behind Game

This will be covered in Dojo 12.

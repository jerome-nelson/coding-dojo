## Recommended Resources
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): has a group of structured questions that are perfect for "whiteboarding practice".   
* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/): not very structured, but good for basic kata completion and 
* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/): good source of information on React and how it works. Can be used as a proof when verifying the workings of React
* [TypeSript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/) by [Basarat Ali Syed](https://github.com/basarat): A must read for understanding and working with TypeScript
